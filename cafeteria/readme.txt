My @validation classes are in package backend.validation

Did not do Exercise E7, E8, E9.

On Exercise E6, I originally had getPreviousMenu and getNextMenu, but could fix the bug where it would crash if i didn't have any menu in the past or future, so i removed them, and i only have the "show default"

In my MenuEJB class, it may be a little messy. I first created some methods and tested them, but then just a few hours before deadline I needed to change them to Menu type, or else my show menu would not work.

The way i structured my code besides from this was good from my point of view. I followed how you structured your projects in the testing folder, and think i got a good structure out of it.
